            | We are a group of 4 Computer Science students developing an e-commerce website for our Senior Design Project. We want our website to be a platform for art and design students to showcase their talent and creativity, so we are looking for students to submit their designs! We will be selling T-shirts with designs from UC Davis students to support the art community. For each shirt sold ($10), the designer/artist will get $1 (about 25% of the earnings after tshirt fees, paypal fees, etc.). We can also promote the artist/designer on our page by sharing an “About Me” of them and linking their portfolio.
