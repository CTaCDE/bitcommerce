                | We are a group of 4 Computer Science students developing a platform for art and design students to showcase their talent and creativity, so we are looking for people to submit their designs! We are selling T-shirts with designs from local artists to support the art community. For each shirt sold ($10), the designer/artist will get $1 (about 25% of the earnings after tshirt fees, paypal fees, etc.). We also can promote the artist/designer on our website by sharing an "About Me‚Äù and linking a portfolio. If you are interested, you should submit a design!
