                | We are a group of 4 Computer Science students developing an e-commerce website for our Senior Design Project. Our website is a platform for art and design students to showcase their talent and creativity, so we are looking for students to submit their designs! We are selling T-shirts with designs from UC Davis students to support the art community. For each shirt sold ($10), the designer/artist will get $1 (about 25% of the earnings after tshirt fees, paypal fees, etc.). We also promote the artist/designer on the website by sharing an About Me‚Äù of them and linking their portfolio.
